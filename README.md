# What is this
This is a bunch of config files I used. I took them from somebody else.

# Dotfiles are all over the internet. What's special about this one
- Tmux on ssh: a server with my dotfiles installed will automatically launch tmux upon ssh.
- Bash prompt displays exit code of last program (if any)
- The hostname in the bash prompt changes color depending on what the host is. This is done by taking a hash of the hostname and converting it to a color number.
